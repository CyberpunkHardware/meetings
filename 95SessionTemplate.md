The categories selected and tags will not restrict the punks who can see your post. Also note that comments on private posts are not showing on the public Activity page but can still be public to people with the password, admins or on a new Activity page we might create for password-protected content.*

## Assess Assemble Activate (AAA)
The goal of the Cyberpunk 9-5 Session is 

- Assess what each other is building

- Assemble people and resources to help each other build the things

- Activate each other to get it done

*Note: projects can be completely independent of Cyberpunk Hardware all types of collaboration are cool, but together we are stronger*

The meeting minutes should just be done in Gitea or using VSCode to Gitea a link could just be posted here if need be. We might want a clear-net version for ease in some cases.
